Dear @everyone in the RPGBot Community,

It is with mixed emotions that I write to you today to announce an important update regarding RPGBot. After several years of development and support, I have made the decision to deprecate RPGBot (Version 1), the software that was initially launched in 2017.

The RPGBot has been a fantastic journey and a labor of love, serving as an invaluable tool for gamers and RPG enthusiasts around the world. However, to provide a more enhanced and seamless user experience, we will continue to provide RPGBot-V2, the latest iteration of our beloved software.

RPGBot-V2 comes with a myriad of new features, improvements, and an overall smoother interface designed to cater to all your RPG needs. With a user-friendly design and enhanced functionalities, RPGBot-V2 promises to take your gaming experience to a whole new level.

What does this mean for RPGBot (Version 1) users?

As of today, RPGBot (Version 1) is officially deprecated. While the existing RPGBot functionality will continue for a short period, until January 1st, I strongly encourage all users to transition to RPGBot-V2 at your earliest convenience to take advantage of the new features and improvements.

How to transition to RPGBot-V2:

- Use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673737213959208980&scope=bot&permissions=805596240) to add RPGBot-V2.
-  For existing RPGBot (Version 1) users, your data and preferences will not automatically transfer. To transfer certain data from RPGBot (V1), use the `rp!recover` command in RPGBot-V2. If there is some piece of data you want that you cannot transfer with this command, please ask us and we may be able to add it.

I understand that change can sometimes be challenging, but I am confident that the transition to RPGBot-V2 will bring about a more enjoyable and enriched gaming experience for all of our users.

Thank you for your unwavering support and understanding as we make this transition. Your feedback and dedication have been invaluable in shaping RPGBot into what it is today.

For any questions or assistance during the transition, our support team is available here in our [Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/mXZg2mk).

Thank you for being a part of the RPGBot community, and I'm excited for this new chapter with RPGBot-V2!

Henry,
RPGBot Creator
